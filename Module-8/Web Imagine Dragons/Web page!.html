    <h2> Band Culture</h2>
    <p class="culture">Despite its quick rise to international stardom, Imagine Dragons maintains a band culture of humility, relatability, and creativity. Lead singer Dan Reynolds once noted that Imagine Dragons is an "atypical band," in that its image diverges from that of the stereotypical rock group. Three of the four members are not tattooed, and the group chooses not to attend afterparties, stereotypical fashions that Reynolds claims are "lifestyle choices" rather any part of "the spirit of rock'n'roll." At one point when the band did choose to attend an afterparty, they noted to each other that "we don't belong here," as they arrived by foot amongst limos and luxury cars.They often bring computers on the road to play League of Legends and connect with fans through their Twitch Channel.</p>
